# 🖥️ RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program VSD

Welcome to my journey through the **SoC Tapeout Program VSD**!  
This repository documents my **week-by-week progress** with tasks inside each week.  

"In this program, we learn to design a System-on-Chip (SoC) from basic RTL to GDSII using open-source tools. Part of India’s largest collaborative RISC-V tapeout initiative, empowering 3500+ participants to build silicon and advance the nation’s semiconductor ecosystem

## 📅 Week 0 — Setup & Tools

| Task | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|---------|
| [**Week 0**](Week0/README.md) | 🛠️ [Tools Installation](Week0/README.md) — Installed **Iverilog**, **Yosys**, and **gtkWave** | ✅ Done |



### 🌟 Key Learnings from Week 0
- Installed and verified **open-source EDA tools** successfully.  
- Learned about **basic environment setup** for RTL design and synthesis.  
- Prepared the system for upcoming **RTL → GDSII flow experiments**.


## 🙏 Acknowledgment
